Have you wanted to have your FPS, coordinates and more always visible?

Well look no further as you can now have this!!

# Features:
- FPS
- Coordinates
- Server IP
- Biome
- Ping
- Position Customization

There's not really anything else to say, except for that you can toggle everything in the config (modmenu required to access config screen, moving the hud is not supported yetâ„¢)


## Planned features:
- colors (possibly with custom conditions)


#### For Developers
To compile for `1.21.5` and below run: `gradle build -PuseCustomProps=true`
The mod would be single-jar across versions, but a singular method changes from void to int between 1.21.5-1.21.6 (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)

##### Contributing
If you are doing development on this mod and you plan to PR at some point, please make sure to test your changes fully before submitting a PR. 

Test all the features and test at least some versions. E.g. test 1.21.8, 1.21.5 and 1.21

Also before PR'ing run `gradle fmt`, this will run the google Java Format thingi and make the code look not ass.


Thank you
